# How to build a portfolio/blog with Vuepress

This morning, I read this article by one of the co-founders of Snipcart. He did this great rundown on how you could build a simple blog with Vuepress by looping over a custom directory of documents.

In this post, I will show you how I built out the site you're currently looking at! Yes, it's all Vuepress. Pretty neat, huh?

And BTW.. The theme is free, check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com)
